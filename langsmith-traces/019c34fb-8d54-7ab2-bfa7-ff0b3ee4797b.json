Despite successfully identifying the STRING ID for NGLY1, further fetching of interaction data couldn't proceed due to method invocation errors. This might require updates or alternative avenues to resolve.\n\nFor more detailed exploration, I recommend ensuring integration updates or leveraging alternate platforms for protein interaction data.
