Further exploration may be needed for precise interaction details.\n\n3. **Doxorubicin Information:**\n   - Doxorubicin, known by several synonyms including \"Adriablastin\" and \"Hydroxydaunorubicin,\" is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent with documented cardiotoxic side effects. It is involved in multiple cancer indications.\n   - The SMILES representation provided, \"COc1cccc...O1\", is a detailed chemical structure useful for further bioinformatics modeling.\n   - Cardiotoxicity is a significant adverse effect of Doxorubicin, often linked with oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in cardiac cells.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Dive deeper into specific molecular interactions between Doxorubicin and the proteins to understand cardiotoxic mechanisms. This might involve reviewing detailed literature and previous studies.\n- Investigate experimental data or case studies on Doxorubicin's impact on these pathways, particularly focusing on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress responses in cardiac tissues.\n  \nIf you need detailed molecular interaction data or further enrichment on specific pathways, let me know, and I can attempt to refine these queries or explore alternative databases."
