It operates by interfering with the growth and spread of cancer cells.\n\n2. **Protein Interactions:**\n   - The STRING database identified SLC22A16 as a protein that interacts with Doxorubicin. This protein is responsible for the transport of organic cations, including Doxorubicin.\n   - BioGRID interactions of SLC22A16 revealed numerous physical interactions with other proteins, providing insights into its functional pathways.\n\n3. **Pathways and Mechanisms:**\n   - Specific pathways involving Doxorubicin's cardiotoxic effects were not directly available from WikiPathways.\n   - However, the interactions involving SLC22A16 could indicate mechanisms by which Doxorubicin influences heart cells and causes cardiotoxicity.\n   - The focus would be on how it is taken up by heart cells or how it affects the heart's cellular environment through these protein interactions.\n\nTo consolidate the pathways and detailed mechanisms, the next step is to align this interaction data with existing literature on Doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. This will give a comprehensive picture of how these interactions contribute to the cardiotoxicity pathway. Let me know if you need further exploration or specific findings from literature sources."
