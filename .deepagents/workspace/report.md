## Summary
Palovarotene shows promise as a treatment for Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) by targeting and inhibiting mechanisms that lead to abnormal bone growth. This is crucial for preventing the debilitating effects of FOP.

## Resolved Entities
| Entity | CURIE | Type |
|--------|-------|------|
| ACVR1 | HGNC:171 | Gene |

## Key Findings
- Palovarotene inhibits the BMP signaling pathway, which is linked to the ACVR1 gene, crucial for bone development.
- ACVR1 mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of FOP, making it a key target for drug intervention.

## Drug Candidates
| Drug | Phase | Mechanism | Source |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Palovarotene | 3 | Inhibits BMP signaling | Clinical trials data |

## Clinical Trials
| NCT ID | Title | Phase | Status |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| NCT03312634 | Efficacy and Safety of Palovarotene | Phase 3 | Active, not recruiting |

## Confidence
The findings are grounded in ongoing clinical trials with Palovarotene showing efficacy in modulating ACVR1-related pathways. However, further data from ongoing trials will be necessary to fully confirm its therapeutic potential in FOP.
