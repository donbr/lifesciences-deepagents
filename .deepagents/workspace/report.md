## Summary
Palovarotene is a drug candidate for treating Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), primarily targeting the ACVR1 gene responsible for the disease's skeletal anomalies. This condition is caused by mutations leading to aberrant ossification.

## Resolved Entities
| Entity | CURIE | Type |
|--------|-------|------|
| ACVR1 | HGNC:171 | Gene |

## Key Findings
- Palovarotene functions by targeting ACVR1, inhibiting excess bone growth typical in FOP patients. 

## Drug Candidates
| Drug | Phase | Mechanism | Source |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Palovarotene | 3 | Inhibits chondrogenesis by interacting with ACVR1 | ClinicalTrials.gov |

## Clinical Trials
| NCT ID | Title | Phase | Status |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| NCT03312634 | Study on the Efficacy of Palovarotene in Treating MO and FOP Symptoms | 3 | Active, not recruiting |

## Confidence
The confidence level in Palovarotene's efficacy and mechanism is high based on results from ongoing clinical trials and genetic studies. The data supports Palovarotene as a potential therapeutic option for FOP, notwithstanding the necessity for further trials to establish long-term safety and efficacy.
